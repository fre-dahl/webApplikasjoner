# Oppgave 1

Noen user stories. Siden det var nevnt 5 stk.
regner jeg med at det ikke var ment 책 dele her prosjektet i 5 stories,
men at vi velger ut noen potensielle random stories.

Jeg er ikke sikker p책 at hva jeg har gjort er riktig, men jeg ser for meg noe s책nn:
## User stories

### Client experience (Denne er litt stor, men viktig 책 ha med i utgangspunktet)
* As the **client** i want to create a system where a company can create and manage exams so that potential course-takers can be evaluated. (pass/fail)


### Admin experience
* As the **admin** i want to save the exam as a blueprint, so that i can use it in the future. (Denne er litt uklar, men sure)

* As the **admin** i want to set a time-limit for the exam. (denne og neste kunne kombineres)

* As the **admin** i want to set the minimum req. right answers so that i can decide if the **course-taker** has passed.


### Course-taker experience
* As a **course-taker** i want to know how many questions i have answered / how many left, so that it is clear during exam.

* As a **course-taker** i want to see results after exam (r/w - ratio), to know if i have passed.
